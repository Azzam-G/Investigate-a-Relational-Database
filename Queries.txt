Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.


/*Query 1*/

SELECT f.title AS film_title,
             c.name AS category_name,
             COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_COUNT
FROM Category c
JOIN film_category f_c
ON c.category_id = f_c.category_id
JOIN Film f
ON f.film_id  = f_c.film_id
JOIN Inventory i
ON f_c.film_id = i.film_id 
JOIN Rental r
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2,1;

Question 2:
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

/*Query 2*/

SELECT f.title AS film_title,
             c.name AS category_name,
             f.rental_duration,
             NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM Category c
JOIN film_category f_c
ON c.category_id = f_c.category_id
JOIN Film f
ON f.film_id  = f_c.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music');

Question 1 Set #2:

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

/*Query 1*/

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_PART('month', r.rental_date) AS rental_month,
           DATE_PART('year', r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
           str.store_id,
           COUNT(*) AS count_rentals
           FROM store str
           JOIN staff stf
           ON str.store_id = stf.store_id
           JOIN rental r
           ON stf.staff_id = r.staff_id
           GROUP BY 1,2,3)t1
ORDER BY t1.count_rentals DESC;


Question 2 Set #2:

We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

/*Query 2*/

WITH t1 AS(
SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name,' ',c.last_name) AS full_name,
             c.customer_id,
             p.amount,
             p.payment_date
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id),

t2 AS(
SELECT t1.customer_id,
             SUM(t1.amount)
FROM t1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10)

SELECT DATE_PART('year', t1.payment_date) AS p_year,
             DATE_PART('month', t1.payment_date) AS p_month,
             t1.full_name,
            count(*) AS pay_countpermonth,
            SUM(t1.amount) AS pay_amount
FROM t1
JOIN t2
ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
WHERE t1.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 3;
